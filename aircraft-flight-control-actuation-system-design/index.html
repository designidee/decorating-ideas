<p>Two actuators are used one to position the flaps and the other to set the elevator trim position. Actuators Airplanes Automatic control Control systems Design and construction Flight control Space vehicles. This article centers on the. Actuators on aircraft perform a number of important functions such as adjusting flight control surfaces like the elevator rudder ailerons flaps slats and spoilers extending and retracting landing gear positioning engine inlet guide vanes and thrust reversers and opening and closing cargo or weapon bay doors. Fly-by-wire actuators use signals from the pilot via the aircrafts flight control system to control flight control surfaces along the vertical pitch longitudinal roll and horizontal yaw axes for safe and coordinated flight.

<p>A design guide and general reference for engineers and upper-level students involved in the specification analysis design development and compliance of aircraft flight control actuation systems though also useful for other types of hydraulic actuation systems. Additionally this course will provide participants an understanding of the design considerations behind these actuation systems. Fly-by-wire flight control actuation is used by helicopters military aircraft commercial transports regional jets and business jets. Aircraft and helicopters use hydraulic circuits to power different systems like flight control actuation landing gear extension and retraction or landing gear door actuation. First published in 1993. Two actuators are used one to position the flaps and the other to set the elevator trim position. Pin On Aviatika.</p>
