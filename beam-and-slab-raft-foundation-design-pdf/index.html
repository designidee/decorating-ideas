<p>Raft foundations Raft foundations also called slab-on-the-ground foundations or floating slabs. Example 128 Annular Raft Foundation Design an annular circular raft for a circular tank whose outer diameter is 12m and is supported by a ring beam of 9m diameter. The Software basically requires a User to enter Raft data for Joints Columns Beams Slabs Continuity. It is desired to design the raft slab shown below to support the column loads for a building as given below. Internal stiffening beams similar to the internal edge beam may be required 6. In heave conditions the slab reinforcement is best placed near the top of the slab to resist. Raft Foundation Pdf Basement Foundation Engineering.</p>
