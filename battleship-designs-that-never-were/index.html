<p>Though the studies resulting from that initial request had some influence on the design of the Pennsylvania class of battleships that class was essentially just an enlargement of the preceding Nevada class. These were to be joined by the four ship Amagi class battle cruiser class. The Montanas the last battleships designed by the US. Amagi was destroyed during the Tokyo earthquake of 1922 and scrapped and Akagi completed as an aircraft carrier. The five Montana -class battleships leviathans designed to dwarf even the giant Iowa -class battleships were authorized for.</p>
