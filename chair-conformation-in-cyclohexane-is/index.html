<p>Chair conformation of cyclohexane is more stable than boat form because in chair conformaion the C-H bonds are equally axial and equatorial ie out of twelve C-H bonds six are axial and six are equatorial and each carbon has one axial and one equatorial C-H bond. Alternate your axial substituents up and down all the way around your cyclohexane. I n chair cyclohexane there are two types of positions axial and equatorial. The different conformations are called conformers a blend of the words conformation and isomer. Answer 1 of 3.</p>
<h3 id="hence-it-has-both-eclipsing-and-bond-angle-strains-and-is-the-least-stable-conformer-of-cyclohexane">Hence it has both eclipsing and bond angle strains and is the least stable conformer of cyclohexane.</h3><p>1 The most stable conformation of cyclohexane is the chair conformation. Cyclohexane can form three different conformations. Chair conformation is the most stable with the lowest energy and. Stability of conformation decided by many factors like angle strain- any deviation from normal bond angles. The most stable conformation of cyclohexane is called chair conformation since it somewhat resembles a chair.</p>

The chair structure of cyclohexane is considered to be the perfect conformation. If you have not already done so you should construct a model of cyclohexane now and use it to follow the subsequent discussion.

<p>Usually at room temperature around 25C all the molecules of cyclohexane occur in chair conformation. Half chair has five C atoms is one plane and one C atom out of the plane. 2 There is no angle or torsional strain in the chair form of cyclohexane. This is because it has low energy. The chair conformation has alternating axial up axial down so once you have that single axial substituent move on to. This leads to a staggered conformation in chair form reducing torsional strain.
