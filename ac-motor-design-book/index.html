<p>A motor will run slower on AC than DC due to the reactance encountered with AC. Here we see a winding diagram for a 3-phase AC induction motor or brushless PM motor IPM having 4 poles and 36 slots. Generators DC Motors AC Theory AC Power AC Generators. In real life the majority of high-power motors use alternating current AC and work in a completely different way. Very small universal motors may be uncompensated. Various types of AC induction motors are available in the market. Electric Motors And Control Techniques Edition 2 Paperback In 2021 Electric Motor Control Techniques Electric Car Conversion.</p>

<p>Theyre what we call induction motors and they make very ingenious use of a magnetic field that rotates. AC induction motors are the most common motors used in industrial motion control systems as well as in main powered home appliances. Under the rubric Animations a series of movie clips portrays the motion of electric machines magnetic fields and space vectors. Simple and rugged design low-cost low maintenance and direct connec-tion to an AC power source are the main advantages of AC induction motors. A motor will run slower on AC than DC due to the reactance encountered with AC. Control engineers working with AC motors in a variety of industrial environments will find the space-and-cost-saving ideas detailed in Sensorless AC Electric Motor Control of much interest.
