<p>WVLT - The chair lift at Gatlinburgs Anakeesta was shut down amid possible safety issues Saturday afternoon officials with the park told Gatlinburg police. As Gatlinburgs first and oldest chairlift to be constructed in the land of Dixie the Gatlinburg Sky Lift had already attracted over 100000 guests within the first 3 seasons of operation. The weather wasnt great but we still managed to go to the top. Step into the sky lift and photograph wild panoramic view of the Smoky Mountain. There is nothing to do once you get to the top but it is a great view and a nice place to take pictures. Youll be more than 1600 feet higher than any other lift can carry you.
