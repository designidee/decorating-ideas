The arm has been 3D printed and there has been made a custom part which is a big and heavy round base on which the arm is located. DESIGN DETAILS The robot under consideration is VRT-502 model which is a 5 DOF stationary articulated robot arm having base shoulder elbow tool pitch and tool roll and consisting of only rotary joints 1.

<p>It allows two surgeons to teleoperate the Raven IV system col-laboratively from two remote sites. Instead of designing a new robot arm this study tries to optimize existing arms belong to known brands. Four to six axes are common in industrial robotics with six axes being the most.

<p>The arm can move and it has IoT capabilities. An articulated robot is a robot which is fitted with rotary joints. Raghavan and associates 3 described the design procedure for the manipulator and gripper of a robot comprising two revolute joints at the shoulder and Figure 1. This is a 3R articulated robotic arm with 4DOF including the end effector. The two possible hollow cross sections ie Rectangular section and Circular Sections is modelled using commercially available 3D modelling tool known as SolidWorks and they are further studied and compared.
