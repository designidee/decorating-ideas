<p><strong>Architectural Design Consideration In Cyclone Prone Areas</strong>, On the other hand during a cyclone heavier the roof the better is the performance of the house. In Queensland architects landscape architects and urban designers are currently on the frontline in providing innovative design solutions for residents of flood-prone areas. Cities or towns with a history of cyclone are classified as cyclone prone areas.</p>
