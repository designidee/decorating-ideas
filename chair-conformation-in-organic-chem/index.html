<p>Follow the recipe for drawing chair conformations and these steps for putting the axial and equatorial substituents in and then practice until it becomes second nature. How to draw chairs. However other cycloalkanes like cyclodecane for example also has a chair conformation. The chair conformation is the most stable due to the following reasons. However sometimes you will be required to use energetics to calculate the exact percentages of each chair in solution. Illustrated Glossary of Organic Chemistry.

<p>Mark makes stuff. Chair conformations of methyl cyclohexane. Just three pairs of parallel lines and youve drawn a perfect chair conformation. Chair Conformation - Axial vs Equatorial on. The A-value represents the difference in energy ΔG between a group being axialequatorial on a cyclohexane ring thus as a group gets bigger its A-value increases reflecting the increasingly high energy needed to flip the ring. For most classes all you will need to know how to do is use equatorial preference to predict the most stable chair conformation.

<p>I hope you will be able to just plug in your values and calculate any cyclohexane derivative conformation precentage at a given temperature. However sometimes you will be required to use energetics to calculate the exact percentages of each chair in solution. The chair reference is just referring to the repeating zig-zag shape across the longitudinal axis of the molecule. The chair conformation allows it to have the closest possible angle which would be 1109 degreesDue to this the strain reduces and results in a lowered energy. Yep thats it. Now that we understand the positions of cyclohexane Im actually going to take like five minutes just to teach you how to draw it. 1 3 Diaxial Gauche Interactions Chair Methylcycohexane Interactive Chemistry Free Energy.</p>
