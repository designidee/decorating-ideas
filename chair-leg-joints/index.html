<p>Sams early chairs from the 1950s and 60s used a very simple joint that was made by taking the side seat rails and clamping them outside edge to outside edge then boring a hole centered so that when the rails were unclamped it left a half round socket where a lathe turned leg would then be made to match Johnson says. An example of an application for this multiple dowel wood joint configuration is a do it yourself chair. Making these joints requires some cleverness. Traditional chairs with turned legs and flat arm rests employed a spigot end to the leg taken through and wedged from the top as 46622 while 46621 is the jointing of a typical modern framework where the overall angle is halved and dowelled together. Chair-Loc will not dry out and become brittle like most wood glues. This is a double shouldered bridle joint also called a Sam Maloof chair joint.

<p>I start by cutting a 34 dado in the chair seat. A mechanical fastener or pin is required. At least the dowel would provide a mechanical connection to reinforce the glue joint. If the glue does give way eventually the cross dowels will still hold the joint together. You can use Chair-Loc to tighten chair rungs and legs doweled or dovetailed joints brush mop hammer.

<p>The corner bridle joint joins two pieces at their ends forming a corner. For bracing chair and table legs. As for the tops of the legs they are normally through morticed in the seat. Making these joints requires some cleverness. Predrill the screw holes for the block in both the block and the frame. When it is as clean as possible work glue into the joint by turning the chair so the joint is vertical. Intricate Elven Tables Wood Joinery Wood Joints Joinery.</p>
