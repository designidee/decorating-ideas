<p>However do I prioritize Cl over the methyl-and isopropyl-group or are the two groups more prioritized due to them being bonded to Hydrogens which take up more space than a Cl-atom. Of these two positions of the Hs the equitorial form will be the most stable because the hydrogen atoms or perhaps the. The chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane. So choosing the more stable chair conformation is straightforward when there is only one group on the cyclohexane.

<p>With this conformation the bond angles are 1109 degrees much closer to the ideal 1095 degrees. These are hydrogens in the axial form. By drawing cyclohexane in a chair conformation we can see how the Hs are positioned. However if there are more groups on the cyclohexane we need to take into consideration the 13-diaxial interaction of all. Which is more stable chair or boat conformation. 6 pt Cl Least stable chair Most stable chair 1 1 1 CH3G kcalmol e For the isomer of 1-chloro-35-dimethylcyclohexane shown below draw in bonds to CH3 and Cl.

<p>It turns out that a chair conformation minimizes what are called transannular interactions in that each carbon on the ring as an axial hydrogen projecting out of the plane of the ring or an equatorial hydrogen more or less in the plane of the ring. In cyclohexane and most of its derivatives the chair conformation is more stable. The chair conformation is a six-membered ring in which atoms 2 3 5 and 6 lie in the same plane atom 1 lies above the plane and atom 4 lies below the plane. By drawing cyclohexane in a chair conformation we can see how the Hs are positioned. With this conformation the bond angles are 1109 degrees much closer to the ideal 1095 degrees. However do I prioritize Cl over the methyl-and isopropyl-group or are the two groups more prioritized due to them being bonded to Hydrogens which take up more space than a Cl-atom. Pin On Mcat.</p>

<p>These are hydrogens in the axial form. If the tert-butyl group is placed in the axial bond then the chair has the highest energy or the least stable conformation. Chemistry questions and answers. Ly d Select the more stable chair conformation of cis-13-diisopropylcyclohexane. The chair conformation is more stable because it does not have any steric hindrance or steric repulsion between the hydrogen bonds. The chair conformation is more stable because it does not have any steric hindrance or steric repulsion between the hydrogen bonds.
