<p>About 28 to 32 inches is an optimum range for chair rail height says Hull. To get that approximate chair rail height measure the ceiling height in inches and divide that number by three. If you are lucky you can find a matching set and even get footing or baseboards to match. Typically you want your chair rail molding to be 13 of the height of the wall from the floor. Today were looking at between 34 and 42. I dont know if this would shorten the look of the height of the top of the wall since we are using the crown also.

<p>I dont know if this would shorten the look of the height of the top of the wall since we are using the crown also. As a stair builder I see the ideal height of the chair rail molding or wainscot paneling to be the same height as the balustrade especially as it ascends the stair wall. For example in rooms with 8-foot to 10-foot ceilings the moulding should be placed 28 to 32 inches high. In almost all instances this will fall into the classic zone for chair rails. In the case of the latter chair rail molding establishes an interiors proportion and scale adding space and elegance to otherwise standard straight-up-and-down spaces. The presentation of a room is important when you want to make a good impression and when you want to be drawn to the room yourself.
