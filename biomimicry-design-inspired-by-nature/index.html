<p>Scientific research in the field of biology alone has already shed light on natures successes and failures throughout billions of years of evolution life flourishing today has successfully evolved while fossils provide evidence of natures inability to overcome diverse challenges. The Biomimicry Institute is a 501c3 not-for-profit organization founded in 2006 that empowers people to seek nature-inspired solutions for a healthy planet. This is called biomimicry. Inspired by nature and utilizing the tools of biotechnology Werewool is developing a platform to design fibers at the DNA level for sustainable textiles with inherent properties such as color moisture management and stretch that meet the demands of todays consumers. Project The DXHOME is the first Bio Autonomous Architecture in the world that works like a plant a tree a forest.
