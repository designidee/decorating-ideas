<p>In this article we will investigate the antenna effect phenomena in detail and the reasons which are responsible for this effect. It has been observed that if the polysilicon gate connects directly to VDD or VSS for a constant highlow input signal and in case any surgeglitch arises in the supply voltage it results in damage of sensitive gate oxide. Ions will get collected on the exposed wafer during polysiliconMetal etching. In this article we will investigate the antenna effect phenomena in detail and the reasons which are responsible for this effect.

<p>To avoid the antenna effect we need to avoid large Interconnect Area to Gate of a MOSFET or we can also use the diode placed near the MOSFET so that the diode will provide a conductive path to substrate if the induced charge is above a limit. The IC fabs normally supply antenna rules that must be obeyed to avoid this problem and violation of such rules is called an antenna violation. Antenna effect in vlsi design ppt download. The antenna effect is a phenomenon that may cause damage to the gate oxide of MOS during the fabrication process especially due to the plasma etching process.

Circuit Speed high Power consumption low Design Area low 4. Download 40 Antenna Effect In Vlsi Design Ppt Download.</p>

<p>Antenna Effect In Vlsi Designs Ppt Plasma Processing IEEE Electron Devices Lett. Illustration of the cause of antenna effect. Inserting Diodes After Detailed Placement After detailed routing to routing congestion problems in upper metal layers. Presently Lithographic processes for IC fabrication use Plasma etching or dry etching. When this ratio exceeds a value specified in a Process Design Kit PDK will leads to Antenna violation. Antenna ratio is defined as the ratio between the physical area of the conductors making up the antenna to the total gate oxide area to which the antenna is electrically connected.

<p>VLSI Design A VLSI Very Large Scale Integration system integrates millions of electronic components in a small area few mm2 few cm2. An antenna is a device for sending or receiving electromagnetic waves. Antenna effect in VLSI implies to the charge collection effect but not to the device called antenna. Because the areasize of the conductor gate area will decide the magnitude of the charge collection. Thus an antenna with a gain of 3 dBd would have a gain of 515 dBi 3 dB 215 dB 10log 164 215 dBi10 Actual Antenna Lengths. A half-wave dipole antenna has a power gain of 164 or 215 dB over an isotropic source. Download 40 Antenna Effect In Vlsi Design Ppt Download.</p>
