<p>The plant is sufficiently compact to be used by urban households and about 2000 are currently in use. The design consists of the assembly of two high. A single plant produces sufficient biogas to at least halve the use of LPG or kerosene for cooking in a household as well as a small amount of solid residue which can be used as fertiliser. From 2003 onwards about 1000 compact biogas plants have been so far installed by ARTIs trained personnel covering both rural as well as urban households in Maharashtra. Therefore a biogas plant of 1 m3 capacity is equivalent to 65 of an LPG cylinder per month. The standard plant uses two tanks with volumes of typically 075 m3 and 1 m3 750l and.

<p>The research was conducted on ARTI model compact biogas plant of 1 m 3 digester and 075 m 3 gasholder in focusing the management of daily collected biodegradable wastes 1-2 kg produced from. Therefore a biogas plant of 1 m3 capacity is equivalent to 65 of an LPG cylinder per month.

Biogas or Gobar Gas Plant is design by Appropriate rural of technology institute ARTI India this biogas digester made by two 1000 and 750 liter Plastic water tank one is called Digester or fermenter tank other is called gas holder tank or movable domeI am sharing on Pakistan Science clubs web for educational and promotional purpose we hope its will helps Pakistani people and PSCs web. It showed a digester made from a 30-gallon drum with an open top inverted into a 55-gallon drum with an open top. The compact plants are made from cut-down high-density polythene HDPE water tanks which are adapted using HDPE or PVC piping.
