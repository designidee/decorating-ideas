<p>The terms biomimicry and biomimetics come from the Greek words bios meaning life and mimesis meaning to imitate. There are three types of biomimicry - one is copying form and shape another is copying a process like photosynthesis in a leaf and the third is mimicking at an ecosystems level like building a nature-inspired city. Organism retrieval abstraction and transfer. There are four areas in which a biomimicry lens provides the greatest value to the design process independent of the discipline in which it is integrated.

Biomimicry is a technological-oriented approach focused on putting natures lessons into practice. Prospecting relevance information accessibility and implementation. The Biomimicry Design Spiral was developed in 2005 by Carl Hastrich an industrial designer who was one of a cluster of devoted individuals that we can thank for building the foundations for biomimicry as we know it today.
