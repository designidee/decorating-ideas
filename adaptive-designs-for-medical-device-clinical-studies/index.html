<p>FDA Finalizes Guidance on Adaptive Designs for Device Studies. Adaptive designs can be applied across all phases of clinical research from early-phase dose escalation to confirmatory trials. The EMA Reflection paper on methodological issues in confirmatory clinical trials planned with an adaptive design CHMPEWP245902 defines a study design as adaptive if the statistical methodology allows the modification of a design element for example sample-size randomization ratio number of treatment arms at an interim analysis with full control of the. The US Food and Drug Administration FDA on Tuesday finalized guidance that lays out how to design medical device clinical trials that allow for changes based on data while maintaining study validity and integrity. Evaluation of medical imaging devices often involves clinical studies where multiple readers MR read images of multiple cases MC for a clinical task which are often called MRMC studies.

An adaptive design is defined as a design that allows modifications to the trial andor statistical procedures of the trial after its initiation without undermining its validity and integrity. The pace of the uptake of adaptive designs in clinical research however has remained well behind that of the statistical literature introducing new methods and highlighting their potential advantages. Trial planning involves several rounds of simulations. Known as adaptive design the method can minimize clinical trial sponsors resource requirements and increase chances of study success.
