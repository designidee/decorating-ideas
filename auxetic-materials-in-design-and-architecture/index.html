Our contribution is to derive new principles for auxetic design from the geometric theory of auxetic deformations recently introduced in 6. The first is the auxetic structural material which allows the surface to be flexible in two directions. .</p>

<p>Auxetic materials deform in an unusual way when stretched or compressed. The opportunities they offer for innovative applications in fashion design and architecture are just starting to be explored. Nanotechnology is pushing materials science beyond the limits of what once seemed impossibleWhen combined with ultra-high-strength concrete nanomaterials such as. The first is the auxetic structural material which allows the surface to be flexible in two directions. The proposed method can easily be extended to the inverse design of other architected materials.
