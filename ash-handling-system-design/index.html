<p>The factors affecting the environment are land for ash disposal pollution on Ground water and surface water. When new power plants were being designed in the 1970s the state of the art ash handling systems at the time were closed loop water recirculation systems that involved a tank farm thousands of feet away from the boiler. This system uses a vacuum design to convey ash in a dry system. Bottom ash is stored dry in a refractory-lined hopper under the boiler. The earliest ash handling systems were simple in cost and design as befits a boiler-relat-ed auxiliary that was merely viewed as a necessary but unsophisticated waste handling sys-tem.

<p>Design and Troubleshooting of Pneumatic Conveying Systems for Fly Ash Handling in Thermal Power Plants Short Intensive Training Course 10-11th April 2015 Organized by Department of Mechanical Engineering Thapar University Patiala Contact Dr. Ash handling equipment is one of the most crucial links in the solid fuel biomass boiler and combustion systems chain. The system consists of installation of Ash Conveying Vessels directly below the fly ash hoppers. The design of the ash handling plant is dependent upon the method of ash disposal. 17 fl y ash is handled through feeder Ejector. Each vacuum pump dedicated to a stream can convey both coarse and fine ash.

<p>BW is the original equipment manufacturer of all Allen-Sherman-Hoff or A-S-H ash handling equipment systems and replacement parts. Installation supervision training parts and equipment service management are provided to help maintain and support efficient operation. The factors affecting the environment are land for ash disposal pollution on Ground water and surface water. Ash that was generated by a coal fired boiler was often handled in one overall system. The vacuum conveying system operates so as to allow sequential ash discharge from ash hoppers into conveying stream which is in continuous operation. DESEIN has been responsible for the design engineering of a large number of Ash Handling Systems for thermal power plants having a total aggregate generating capacity of over 35000 MW.
