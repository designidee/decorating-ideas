<!--html tag code -->
<p><strong>Aquarium Trickle Filter Design</strong>, Also called wetdry filters trickle filters are designed to expose the water to as much air as possible. Any medium through which aquarium water is passed will eventually become a biological filter but the goal in filter design is to create a stage which needs minimum cleaning which will remove or kill the bacteria passing on clean clear water. The filter is designed for use with submersible pumps such as the Danner Mag Drive Series.</p>

<p>It is a biotower a canister with patent designed chambers that consist of a fixed porous bed that can either be ceramic or plastic media over which aquaculture primal wastewater flows downward and causes a layer of microbial slime biofilm to grow covering the bed of media. This is accomplished by allowing the aquarium water to trickle over a container of media such as plastic balls strands or floss. This top half being above the water level was the dry portion of the filter At the top of the original Mini-Reef brand filters was a rotating sprinkler that rained the water from the tank evenly over a spiral wound filter media called DLS double layered spiral pad. Seems the design of the subject filter might have considered using a filter that required zero power. Not powerful like todays filters but perfect for a filter like we are discussing.</p>
